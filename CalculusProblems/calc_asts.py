Derivatives:
 Introducing derivatives:
  - rate of change, average rate of change
    - be able to find given any f(x), a polynomial, and a starting and ending point
   - proving derivatives a polynomial f(x) using the definition of a derivative- lim(x->h)((f(a+h) - f(a))/h)
    - be able to accomplish this given any function:
      - different types of problems: polynomials, square roots, rational  
  - Different derivative rules
    - addition
    - subtraction
    - multiplication
    - power rule
    
 Finding derivatives:
  - word problems (possibly use natural language processing)
  - instantaneous velcotiy, speed, acceleration
  - trig functions, combinations of trig functions
    - proofs for the derivatives of different trig functions
