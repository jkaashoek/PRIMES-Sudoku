\section{Conclusion}

We present a constraint-based iterative algorithm to automatically generate new fill-in-the-blank type problems. We used sudoku and fillomino puzzles as case studies, as their descriptions fit naturally with constraint solvers. Our algorithm was able to generate hundreds of thousands of both types of puzzles over different sizes. We are currently extending our system to also create python programming problems, on which we already have some initial results. We believe a constraint-based approach provides a generic and flexible mechanism for teachers to specify different constraints that they would like a problem to have; we can then use efficient constraint solvers to automatically generate new problems.
