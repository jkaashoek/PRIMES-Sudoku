Students learn by practicing over lots of problems, but generating
fresh problems that have specific characteristics such as using a
certain set of concepts or being of a given difficulty level are a
tedious task for a teacher. In this paper, we present an iterative
constraint-based technique for automatically generating problems which
is general enough for many domains. Our technique takes as parameters
the problem definition, the complexity function, and domain-specific
semantics-preserving transformations. We present an instantiation of
our technique over automated generation of sudoku puzzles, and are
currently extending our technique to generate Python programming
problems. Since defining complexity of a sudoku puzzle is still an
open research question, we use machine learning to learn a function
that predicts the hardness of a sudoku puzzle using lots of labelled
sudoku puzzles from various online sources. Our technique was able to
efficiently generate more than 200,000 interesting sudoku puzzles of
different sizes (9x9, 16x16, 25x25) and of different complexity
levels.
